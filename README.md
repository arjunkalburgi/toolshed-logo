Client Product - Logo for Toolshed

## The Goal 

Create a logo for Toolshed, the website for equipment rental, that is clean and geometrical. 

## The Approach 

The client showed me the Font Awesome wrench icon, which they were currently using as a stand-in logo, and some images of logos for me to use as inspiration - specifically commenting that they were based on fundamental geometric shapes. 

I set out to build a logo that was simple like the geometric examples and also referred to tools in some way like the wrench. 

## The Process

First I set to design around the idea of a shed. The shed is much more inclusive that choosing any particular tool (like the wrench) and would allow the company to grow in a number of directions without having to change their branding. A toolshed can contain any number of tools, whereas a wrench only refers to a certain type of tools (small handhelds). 

I came up with the following designs and sent them back to the client for their opinion.

The client worried that it may be unclear that the geometric icon could be distinguished as a shed. So I made roof-ends on the icon. 
The client also wanted to see what the logo would look like with the shed to the left of the text (instead of in the middle).

This would be the final designs that the client was sent. Everything I worked on is here in this Github repository.
